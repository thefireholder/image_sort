do not reinvent the wheel
use tools provided

sklearn for kin
cv for bilinear interpolation

first, must install proper version to have sift included

pip install opencv-python==3.4.2.16
pip install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.2.16 


also need to erase all  .ds_store
find . -name '.DS_Store' -type f -delete

(contrib package)

look at ppt in the file for code



you have to normalize your shift descriptor
cv2.normalize

accuracy function can be found in sklearn
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html

3 billion result
12:10-1:30 we can talk about it in office hour

	create result folder
	use np.save
	it uses address as first argument

	put everything you have in that result folder
